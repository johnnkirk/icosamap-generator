icosamap-generator
==================

An early implementation of Bucky Fuller's icosahedral projection of the world map

During the year of 1970 at UCLA, John Kirk wrote a FORTRAN program to plot to paper
the world map coastlines indicated by a publically available CIA-published database
of data points using a CalComp pen plotter via Richard Buckminster Fuller's projection
of latitude/longitude coordinates onto an icosahedral shape.

A summary paper describing the process, and a paper plot of the result was sent to
Bucky Fuller's office in January of 1971 seeking his comments.

Some details of the original process have been lost in the intervening years, but the
information remaining has been used to attempt a replication of that work using modern
facilities -- at multiple points over the time since the work was originally done.
